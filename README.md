Hello! Welcome to the AMI (Anti-Malaria Intelligence) initiative. We are a digital hub driven by a life-saving mission to combat malaria, one mosquito net at a time. Born out of the desire to use technology for maximum good, AMI was created to address a dire need. Every day, countless children in malaria-prone regions risk their lives due to the simple absence of a $2 mosquito net. We believe that everyone deserves a safe night's sleep and a chance at a healthy life.

AMI is a pseudo-intelligent chatbot Using state-of-the-art technology like vue3 and GPT-3.5, AMI aims to educate, inspire, and facilitate contributions to this noble cause.

The goal? To motivate donations and social shares, creating a ripple effect of awareness and action.

You can play a part in this life-saving mission. With your support, we can reach more children and provide them with the protection they need against malaria.

Welcome to the AMI community, where one small action can save a life.
